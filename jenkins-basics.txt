How to check Jenkins pipeline Jobs steps syntax?
Go to pipeline Syntax under any Jenkins Job and select the step, which you want to see the syntax.


Jenkins Scripted Pipeline Syntax:
Jenkinsfile (Scripted Pipeline)
node {  
    stage('Build') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Test') { 
        // 
    }
    stage('Deploy') { 
        // 
    }
}


Jenkins pipeline with Skeleton:
node{
    println "Starting Java pipeline for CI-CD";
    stage("check-out"){
        println "check-out stage is yet to be implemented";
    }
    
    
    stage("maven-build"){
        println "maven-build stage is yet to be implemented";
    }
    
        stage("deployment"){
        println "deployment stage is yet to be implemented";
    }
    
    
    
}
